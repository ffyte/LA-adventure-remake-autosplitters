# LA-adventure-remake-autosplitters

This is a work in progress to create ingame time usage for speedrunning Lucasarts games remasters/special editions.

Currently this supports: MI SE steam, MI2: SE steam, DoTTR GoG.

ToDo: Hashes for MI 1/2 gog and memory addresses for DoTT and MI 1/2. Also would need to find the windows store versions of these for similar testing.

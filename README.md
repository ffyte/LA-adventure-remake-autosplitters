# LA-adventure-remake-autosplitters

This is a work in progress to create ingame time usage for speedrunning Lucasarts games remasters/special editions.

Currently this supports: MI SE, MI2: SE, DoTTR GoG & Steam.

ToDo: Memory address for DoTT Windows store.

Full Throttle and Grim Fandango use a different system, which unfortunately didn't have an ingame time, as far as I could tell. Systems for these games should be investigated later.
